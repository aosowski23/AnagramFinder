# AnagramFinder
The purpose of this assignment was to take a large text file as an input (a dictionary of words), and determine all of the anagrams that are present in that file. This implementation relied on a hash table and quadratic probing to place the anagrams into specific buckets. The runtime is O(n(n+k)).
